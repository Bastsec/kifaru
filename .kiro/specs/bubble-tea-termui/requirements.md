# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing terminal UI implementation from the low-level `golang.org/x/term` package to the Bubble Tea framework. The current terminal UI provides a chat-like interface for interacting with Sketch's AI coding agent, displaying various message types (user, agent, tool use, git commits, errors, budget, auto-formatting, port monitoring), handling user input with special commands, and managing complex terminal state including concurrent message processing. The migration should preserve all existing functionality while leveraging Bubble Tea's component-based architecture for better maintainability, enhanced user experience, improved terminal handling, and better separation of concerns between UI rendering and business logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Sketch, I want the terminal UI to maintain all current functionality after the Bubble Tea migration, so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the terminal UI SHALL display the HTTP URL and help message exactly as before
2. WHEN I type commands like "help", "budget", "usage", "browser", "exit" THEN the system SHALL respond with identical functionality to the current implementation
3. WHEN I execute shell commands with "!" prefix THEN the system SHALL execute them and optionally send results to the LLM with "!!" prefix
4. WHEN I send messages to the AI agent THEN the system SHALL display agent responses with proper formatting and emoji indicators
5. WHEN the agent uses tools THEN the system SHALL display tool usage with appropriate icons and formatting using the existing template system
6. WHEN git commits are made THEN the system SHALL display commit information with GitHub links when available
7. WHEN I exit the application THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics and pushed branch information exactly as before
