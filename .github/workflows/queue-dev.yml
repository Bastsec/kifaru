# This is a copy of queue-main.yml, but with a different branch pattern.
# It does not push the result anywhere or notify Discord; it logs instead.
# It is meant for people changing how the commit queue works:
# You can hack on the workflows, push to queue-dev-$USER, and iterate.
# Please keep this file in sync with queue-main.yml.
