# Simplified Commit Queue
#
# (Force) push to "queue-main-$USER" a potential change, and
# this job will push it main if it passes pre-commit and tests,
# which will run in parallel. The push may fail if the commit
# cannot be pushed cleanly because it needs to be rebased, which
# will happen especially if another developer pushes a change at
# roughly the same time.
#
# Please keep this file in sync with queue-dev.yml.
