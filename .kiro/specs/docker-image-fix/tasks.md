# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Enhance Docker image reference handling
  - Create a more robust DockerImageReference struct to manage image references
  - Implement methods to convert between different reference formats
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Implement fallback mechanism for Docker image pulling
  - [ ] 2.1 Create a cascading pull strategy
    - Implement ordered list of image references to try (hash, version, latest)
    - Add retry logic with appropriate backoff for transient issues
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_
  
  - [ ] 2.2 Enhance the LaunchContainer function to use the fallback strategy
    - Modify the existing function to try multiple image sources
    - Add proper logging at each step of the fallback process
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Improve Docker error handling and messaging
  - [ ] 3.1 Create a DockerError type with categorized error types
    - Implement error classification for different Docker-related errors
    - Add context-specific suggestions for each error type
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 4.3_
  
  - [ ] 3.2 Enhance error messages with troubleshooting guidance
    - Add detailed error messages with actionable steps
    - Include links to documentation where appropriate
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement Docker image validation
  - [ ] 4.1 Create validation function for Docker images
    - Check for required components in the image
    - Verify compatibility with the current sketch version
    - _Requirements: 3.2_
  
  - [ ] 4.2 Add validation to the image pulling process
    - Integrate validation checks after successful image pull
    - Provide clear error messages for validation failures
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Update Docker image publishing process
  - [ ] 5.1 Modify the image tagging strategy
    - Tag images with both hash and version tags
    - Ensure "latest" tag is updated appropriately
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
  
  - [ ] 5.2 Update CI/CD pipeline for Docker image publishing
    - Ensure images are published as part of the release process
    - Add verification steps to confirm image availability
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [ ] 6. Add unit tests for new functionality
  - [ ] 6.1 Write tests for DockerImageReference
    - Test conversion between different reference formats
    - Test equality and comparison operations
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2_
  
  - [ ] 6.2 Write tests for the fallback mechanism
    - Test the cascading pull strategy with mocked Docker responses
    - Test retry logic and error handling
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.1_
  
  - [ ] 6.3 Write tests for error classification and messaging
    - Test error categorization for different Docker errors
    - Test message generation with appropriate suggestions
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Add integration tests
  - [ ] 7.1 Create tests for the complete image pulling workflow
    - Test with various Docker states and network conditions
    - Test fallback behavior with unavailable images
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_
  
  - [ ] 7.2 Create tests for custom image handling
    - Test validation of custom images
    - Test error handling for invalid custom images
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Update documentation
  - [ ] 8.1 Update user documentation with Docker troubleshooting
    - Add section on Docker image requirements
    - Include common issues and their solutions
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.2, 4.3_
  
  - [ ] 8.2 Update developer documentation
    - Document the Docker image publishing process
    - Explain the tagging strategy and versioning approach
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_
