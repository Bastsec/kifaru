# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds pseudo-terminal (PTY) support to the existing bash tool in the claudetool package. Currently, the bash tool executes commands using regular pipes for stdout/stderr, which limits its ability to run interactive commands and programs that require terminal-like behavior. Adding PTY support will enable the tool to execute commands that need a real terminal environment, such as interactive prompts, terminal-based applications, and commands that behave differently when connected to a TTY.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the bash tool, I want to execute commands that require PTY support, so that I can run interactive applications and commands that need terminal behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bash command is executed with PTY enabled THEN the system SHALL create a pseudo-terminal for the command execution
2. WHEN a command writes to stdout/stderr in PTY mode THEN the output SHALL be captured from the PTY master
3. WHEN a command requires terminal input in PTY mode THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate terminal characteristics
4. WHEN a PTY-enabled command completes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up the PTY resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to control when PTY mode is used, so that I can choose the appropriate execution mode for different types of commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bash tool input includes a "pty" parameter set to true THEN the system SHALL execute the command using PTY mode
2. WHEN the "pty" parameter is false or omitted THEN the system SHALL use the existing pipe-based execution
3. WHEN PTY mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. WHEN PTY mode is used with background execution THEN the system SHALL support both modes together

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PTY support to work across different platforms, so that the tool functions consistently in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PTY support is used on Unix-like systems THEN the system SHALL use appropriate PTY system calls
2. WHEN PTY support is requested on unsupported platforms THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to pipe mode with a warning
3. WHEN PTY allocation fails THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN PTY mode is used THEN the system SHALL set appropriate terminal size and characteristics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing tests to continue working while new PTY functionality is properly tested, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing tests are run THEN they SHALL continue to pass without modification
2. WHEN new PTY-specific tests are added THEN they SHALL cover both successful PTY execution and error cases
3. WHEN PTY tests are run THEN they SHALL verify proper terminal behavior and output capture
4. WHEN PTY cleanup is tested THEN the tests SHALL verify proper resource management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PTY mode to handle timeouts and process management correctly, so that long-running or stuck processes don't cause issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PTY command times out THEN the system SHALL properly terminate the process and clean up PTY resources
2. WHEN a PTY command is killed THEN the system SHALL close the PTY master and slave file descriptors
3. WHEN PTY mode is used with background execution THEN the system SHALL manage PTY resources for long-running processes
4. WHEN multiple PTY commands run concurrently THEN each SHALL have isolated PTY resources
